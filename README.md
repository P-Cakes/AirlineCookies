# AirlineCookies
I'm playing around and trying to make a google chrome extension which you can run in order to search random flights to do something
to your cookies. I know that airlines use cookies to see when you're looking up flights, so that they can raise the price. 
I wonder what would happen if this extension makes you continously search random flights.

Will every flight become much more expensive?
Is this pointless? Is it better to just clear cookies and use incognito when shopping for flights?
I hope to find out.
